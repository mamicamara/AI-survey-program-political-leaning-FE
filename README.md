# Artificial Intelligence - AI Survey Program

## About this Project
Data mining is essential for understanding customers and making informed decisions about products and promotions. This project focuses on developing a program that uses machine learning to determine the political leaning of users based on a survey. You will write this program in C++.

## Purpose
The objective of the AI Survey Program is to predict a user's political party affiliation before they complete the survey. The program will collect data through a series of questions and analyze responses to provide an accurate guess regarding the user's political beliefs.

## Application Dependencies and Tools
The application is developed in either:
- **C++**
- Relevant libraries for data handling and machine learning algorithms may be used (e.g., Weka for Java).

## Survey Design
1. Present users with questions that feature answer options reflecting different political beliefs.
   - **Example Question:** What should the government do to help the poor?
     - A. Make it easier to apply for assistance.
     - B. Allow parents to use education funds for charter schools.
     - C. Create welfare-to-work programs.
     - D. Nothing.
2. The final question should inquire about the user's political party affiliation. The program should support at least four political party storages.
3. As more data is collected, the program should store information effectively to enhance prediction accuracy.
4. Implement a system where answers correspond to multiple political parties, assigning weight to responses based on relevance.
5. Your program will include data storage for responses, question generation, and machine learning capabilities to improve the accuracy of party affiliation predictions.
6. The completed program should efficiently survey users and guess their political party affiliation before they finish answering all questions.
